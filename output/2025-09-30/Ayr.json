He's hard to catch on the all-weather but the turf is slightly different to the all-weather and we're not sure if we're going too hard or not hard enough. He's still quite an exciting horse. If you look at the sectionals at Musselburgh in a very strong race last month it was very good. We probably used up a lot of petrol with Gweedore and I think if we'd have been left alone then we'd have been first or second. That's Ayr Gold Cup form and we're taking on Class 2 handicappers, so he's interesting. He's obviously very fast. 07-05-25"

With racing she's sharpened up a bit and two starts ago at Haydock, when she was third, she ran well in quite a decent race won by Qaseem. I felt that she's speeded up, so I dropped her back to 5f on Sunday at Beverley and she ran a cracker to finish second, beaten only a neck by Mission Command. She was unlucky as she just didn't get the gap when she needed it. I'm not sure where she'll go next, but it'll probably be a stiff 5f or 6f. 28-08-24"

For a horse who needs the race to be run at an end-to-end gallop he did not enjoy proceedings on Town Moor as they crawled most of the way before it developed into a sprint, so all things considered it was a fine effort. Both of his runs for me have been over 7f but I am trying him over a mile at Carlisle on Wednesday. His current mark of 73 is very fair and I would be very hopeful of him winning before long. 22-06-22"
